        <h2>The nightmare before christmas</h2>
        <p>
            A wonderful movie, can watch it on any of the 3 end of the year holidays,
            catchy songs and decent movie for kids to get into a different form of animation
            and art sytle.

        <h2>Corps Bride</h2>
        <p>
            A greate movie to get kids further into spooky forms of anumated films,
            a bit slow at the start and the gloomines of it all is a change of pace from
            the usual bright, happy and overal "magical" usual kids movies. Shows kids to not be 
            afraid of those that look, differently, even if they're a dead roating corps, with a talking worm.
            As well, to not be all the spooked by things that seem scary. Its a great movie to go back to 
            from time to time.
