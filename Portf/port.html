            The site, displays reddit posts,allow users to view them and play

            own voice, ask questions about to ChatGPT, sumarise the post,
            search, and create a playlist. The Playlist mainly consists of the
            posts links, since reddits rules, do not allow the storage of posts
            information. If users, want to make a playlist or use GPT, change
            voices with 11Labs or clone their own, they would need to create an
            account, and pay a fee to do so.
