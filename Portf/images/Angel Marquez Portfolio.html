              FrontEnd/FullStack engineer, with Experience in cyber, scripting and much more. Graduated from CSU Chico, hopefully not dead by the time you see this,
              hopefully not in the military, and lastly, hopefully not on the street, if either of the two failed.

                Developed a Google extension application, using RedditAPI, vercel, OpenAI, JS, Render, SupaBase and ElevenLabs.
                The application, allows users, to have reddit posts and comments read to them, as well have it summarized by ChatGPT.
                Users could also, pick voices to set the mood of the post they listen to, as well ask questions to the application regarding 
                the post.

                Developed using HTML, CSS, React,bootstrap, Vercel,Render, OpenAI, SupaBase and ElevenLabs. The site, displays reddit posts,
                allow users to view them and play them, as if they where taps. They can change the voices, clone thier own voice, ask questions about
                the post to ChatGPT, sumarise it, search for similar posts, and create a playlist. The Playlist mainly consists of the posts links,
                since reddits rules, do not allow the storage of posts information. If users, want to make a playlist or use GPT, change voices with 11Labs
                or clone their own, they would need to create an account, and pay a fee to do so.

                Developed using HTML, CSS and JS, hosted on Vercel, later moved to AWS. This is my third or forth Portfolio,
                what makes it different, is that I actually took the time to fully develop it, layout the display, made sure to apply what
                I learned, and make it how I wanted. This, site, displays my history, accompleshes and what I can do. The image above, shows what
                it used to look like, when it was being developed and hosted locally, showsing the difference between what, it was and what it is now.
