element selectors, target all tags that are being modified in css
```css
   h1{
    color: green;
   } 
```
Above would make all header 1 tags be green

Class selectors are classes you can create, it is made as fallows
```css
    .red-heading{
        color:red;
    }
```
```html
    <h2 class='red-heading'>this is an example</h2>
```
